    <h3> Welcome to Connect 4 with a bit of an EXPLOSION! 
         The rules are simple, but a little different. 
         You or your opponent must achieve 4 kittens or puppies in a row. 
         However, either player has the option to use a CATBOMB to erase
         the opposing player's last move. 
         Use this wisely, each player only gets 1 CATBOMB per game. 
         Happy playing!
    </h3>
